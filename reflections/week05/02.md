## Questions

>1. What are the three types of relationships?

One to One, One to Many, and Many to Many are the three types of relationships in the MongoDB

>2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

linking uses a foreign key to link comments. An advantage is that addition comments will not grow the original "blog post" document, making it less likely that the application will run in the maximum document size 

>3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

It is hard to manage when the variables constantly change - such as the book example, the volume may be high one day and low the next. They can also have other categories embedded in it - which can be easily overlooked.
