# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I felt as though this was a really good week. I definately feel as though I need more practice working with servers - and I unfortunately didn't get the chance to code much during the hackathon specifically on the server side. I really liked when we were working on the planet party project and my code started working properly it was a huge victory for me! I can't exactly pinpoint what im struggling with, but i know that I'll be much better with server stuff with more practice and repitition.
