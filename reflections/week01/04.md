## Questions

>1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Wireframing is a great way to come up with the design and small details of a webpage before you start coding so that all you have to do is just code what the mock up is. It's handy so that you have some direction with what you are wanting to code and to make sure you like what you are about to code. 

>2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are containers, rows and columns. Each one is a layer that is helpful for putting content exactly where you want it to go. 

>3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I do think that wireframes are worth the time energy and efford that they require. Its helpful to know exactly what you are wanting to code ahead of time so that you have a sort of "reference" to use while you are trying to code your webpage.
