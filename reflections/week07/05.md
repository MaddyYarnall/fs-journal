# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This was a decent week. Working with a partner was a little bit difficult but we got through it and had each other's backs. We ended up not being able to pass the project however we did get very close. Kyle was an incredible partner to have. One thing I wish we could have done better is getting the server up and running sooner.
