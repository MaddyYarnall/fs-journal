## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

since the work is spread out and on a bigger application they would each have more work than with more people, communication on what they are doing, how they are doing it, and why they are doing it is important so that no one is out of the loop on whats going on. That way there arent any miscommunication errors. 

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

There needs to be more sprints and extra communication. Larger teams are able to cover more surface at a time while smaller teams have more duties per person which leaves room for miscommunication if they arent all on the same page.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

 the set of tradeoffs between the speed of development and the quality of the software delivered. There is Good service Cheap wonâ€™t be Fast, Good service Fast wonâ€™t be Cheap, and Fast service Cheap wonâ€™t be Good.
