## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

Nested routes allow for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other. 

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

A nested route example is when you have a component such as a post and you want to be able to create a new post, there might be a form / create post component that you need to route to through the already created component. In that specific case, you would use a nested route to route to the other component to create that post.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes! You can pass parameters through nested routes. A time you would use them is if you have more data of a particular type that you are wishing to display on your page.
