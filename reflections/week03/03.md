## Questions

>1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

The two common operations that we will set in the handler are get and set. 

>2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

Well, the get operator takes two parameters, the object itself and the property being accessed. So, we need the custom override called trap. We can also add a trap for set as well
