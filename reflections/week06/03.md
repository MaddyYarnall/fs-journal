## Questions

>1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecycle hooks allow you to know when your component is created, added to the DOM, updated, or destroyed.

>2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

We have utilized lifecycle hooks in our afternoon projects by using them to manipulate the DOM to have specific components exactly where we want them / when we want them to show up on the page / when we want them to change or when we want them to be destoryed.

>3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

I think one of the most common mounting hooks we have used in our afternoon projects is the onMounted. Meaning the specific component loads right when the user goes to that page.
