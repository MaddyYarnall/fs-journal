## Questions

>1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them.

>2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

the underscore prefix is what makes things hidden/private. So, some of the problems that could arrise with using that is having something not show up when you want it to because maybe you forgot that it was hidden/private

You would use an underscore to create a private variable in an ES6 class. You would do this to prevent unauthorized access.
