This week honestly went so well for me. It was crazy how well those afternoon challenges help understand the concepts that we learned in class along with adding on the new information. Some struggles are probably starting a new project with bootstrap. BootStrap is super helpful, but I still struggle with it a little bit, but once I get all of the blocks figured out, the styling is super fun. A victory for me was probably the first day we learned about bootstrapn and our afternoon challenge was to create that webpage. I felt like I did really good and after a bit of help with a few things, I was super excited when everything started coming out exactly how I planned it. Overall this was a really great week for me :)
