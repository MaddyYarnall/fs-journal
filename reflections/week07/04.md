## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We mainly used the pair programming this week, however we didn't use any documentation.

2. What went well this week?

The design portion of the project went very well. We also got majority of our functionality working and pretty fast. 

3. What would you do differently?

Try to get the server up and running sooner - it was hard with two people trying to work on it at the same time. We would also maybe swap client / server more often and push more often to prevent larger merge conflicts.
