## Questions

> 1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A pseudo class is a CSS selector expressed by using a colon (:). Some of the most common ones I think I will be using includes :hover, :required, and :root.

>2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

CSS specificity is the "level of importance" almost in which the CSS selecotrs are used. If the number is low, it means it takes the highest priority when CSS chooses which selector to use. It's beneficial to me because when I need to use a CSS selector, I am able to pin point exactly which item I am needing to style.

>3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

The !important feature is very useful in overriding anything you have already put down in CSS, however, there shouldn't really ever be a time you will need to use !important since its such a powerful feature. If you use !important too many times, one of the biggest issues you could run into is it messing up your entire CSS code and changing your entire project.
