## Questions

>1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The main most common way to write information to the console is using the console.log(' '). The main reason you would use this is to test a specific piece of your code in JS to make sure everything is working properly.

>2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab is the tab that allows you to see the breakdown of HTML and CSS. This can be helpful so that you can see in real-time if something is wrong. You can also make changes and see them happen in real time. 

>3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using the debugger is going to be a better way to debug your code. Mainly because it will stop your code wherever you put the debugger so that if there are any errors you can catch where they are happening and it will give you a better idea about where that bug is located and it will usually tell you what it is that you need to fix.
