## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

Virtuals are additional fields for a given model, meaning you do not have to include them in your data, they will populate for you in the server. 

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

A time you would use a virtual would be when working with a large set of data, using the virtual "fullname" to combine this.firstname and this.lastname to return the clients first and last name in a single string. 

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

You would search by a virtual properties value by using the 'get' method or the 'set' method. Both of them will use the virtuals and grab the information you need.
