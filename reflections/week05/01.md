## Questions

>1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding or "appending" that information to the end of a URL. This information is stored in the query string and is captured by the website when it reads the URL. 

>2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

The query string portion of a URL is the part of the URL after the ? question mark. If your query string has multiple query parameters, theyre separated by the & and sign. 

>3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Query parameters would be helpful when writing my servers because in case I need to access on e single part of an object I can just do that through my URL instead of having to write either a new function or something else that would get me straight to the object.
