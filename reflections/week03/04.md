> **📖 [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

>1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

A one-to-many dependency between objects should be defined without making the objects tightly coupled.
It should be ensured that when one object changes state, an open-ended number of dependent objects are updated automatically.

>2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The observer pattern consists of three ingredients — the “subject”, the observer, and the objects

>3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The template has built in features that are super helpful for manipulating the dom and including features that are good for styling. The proxy is also super helpful for accessing certain objects and items in arrays.
