> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

When people try to write JS is a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom. One of the biggest signs of Callback Hell is when there is a pyramid at the bottom full of curly braces and parentheses })

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

asynchronous means of or requiring a form of computer control timing protocol in which a specific operation begins upon receipt of an indication (signal) that the preceding operation has been completed. Or to simplify it, meaning that of or requiring a specific order in which code is run. Callbacks, like in asynchronous javascript, are involved becuase they dont have a specific order in which it is run

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

The three ways to avoid and fix callback hell are to keep your code shallow, modularize, and to handle every snigle error. Keeping your code shallow makes code easier to read and allows you to move the functions and reference them by their names. Modularizing means creating modules, or libraries to keep your data stored so its not all over the place. Finally, handling all the errors not only makes your code more readable, but it also makes your code stable
