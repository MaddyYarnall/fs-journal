## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

The purpose of async / await is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs.  Async functions always return a promise.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

If a Promise is passed to an await expression, it waits for the Promise to be fulfilled and returns the fulfilled value. If the value is not a Promise, it converts the value to a resolved Promise, and waits for it. If the Promise is rejected, the rejected value is thrown.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

Some of the primary benefits of async and await include the fact that its SO much easier to debug. The code itself is also super easy to read and cleans it up a little bit. And because async and await uses promises, it will always return either rejected, resolved, or pending
