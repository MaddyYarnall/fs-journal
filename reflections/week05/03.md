## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is setting a specific time limit for each task you assign it to, to be completed

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

the first strategy i will implement is using a timer app. Its a good way to keep yourself accountable and not lose track of time. another one is to plan out my time boxing before I start my tasks so that I have a good plan of how much time each task gets. Finally, I will make sure I take breaks between tasks. Especially if one of my time box tasks is an hour or longer, make sure to take breaks between. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

Timeboxing allows me to not spend too long on one specific thing. It helps with time management a lot. I could have benefited from time boxing while working on my last checkpoint. I think I spent too long trying to get the quotes to work that I wasn't able to work on the weather or the to-do count.
