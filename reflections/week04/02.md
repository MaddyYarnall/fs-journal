## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

The three states of a promise are Pending, Resolved, and Rejected. Pending is the initial state, before the promise succeeds or fails. Resolved is a completed promise and Rejected is a failed promise. 

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises are helpful in resolving the issues of callback hell because unlike regular asynchronous javascript, they work in a very specific and particular order. Until the promise is reloved or rejected, a new process wont start. 

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

The main difference between promise.then(success, error) and promise.then(success).catch(error) is that in case if success calback returns a rejected promise, then only the second form is going to catch that rejection.
