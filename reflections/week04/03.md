## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

The purpose of async / await is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs.  Async functions always return a promise.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

If a Promise is passed to an await expression, it waits for the Promise to be fulfilled and returns the fulfilled value. If the value is not a Promise, it converts the value to a resolved Promise, and waits for it. If the Promise is rejected, the rejected value is thrown.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
