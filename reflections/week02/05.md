# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Im not going to lie, this week was a struggle. I know that I'm doing so much better now than I was at the beginning of the week which is a really good thing and I know that I will just continue to get better and better at using JavaScript. A huge victory for me was working on the checkpoint project. It doesn't work exactly how I want it to, however, there was a big road block I hit about half way through and with some preserverence (and quite a bit of googling) I was able to get that specific part to work and I was so proud of myself. It's not the prettiest idle click game in the world, but 99% of it is functional and I'm very proud of what I was able to accomplish when I was doubting myself at the start. Starting a project is definately the hardest part, but I was able to overcome that and create something pretty cool!
