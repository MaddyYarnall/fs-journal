## Questions

>1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git to ensure all code shared between programmers is conflict-free. It also allows developers to access old code before the most recent changes were made.

>2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Branches are useful for testing different code without having to change the original code. It's helpful for developers working in a team so that each developer can work on what they want without changing the orginal code.

Git is the local tracking process, GitHub is the cloud storage for your code
