## Questions

> 1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

My favorite is just all of Bootstrap- being able to style my entire page without having to use CSS is so much better! I love that I can just use CSS to fix minor things that Bootstrap couldn't do, but it made styling my webpage a hundred times faster once I got used to using the Bootstrap commands.

> 2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I saw that W3 schools has a lot of awesome mock templates that are great for trying to come up with a design for your webpage. Another good idea is to wireframe using microsoft paint or something similar and laying out your containers, rows, and columns of your site so that you have a general idea of how it is going to get laid out.

> 3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

A website with good design makes it easier for the consumer to navigate through it. Especially one that is easier on the eyes. If a consumer can navigate through it and can access everything they need to, they are going to be more likely to reccommend your website to other people which will get more views, or they are more likely to use your webiste for what it was intended for wether that be an online store or a blog page.
