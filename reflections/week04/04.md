## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. REST is an architectural style, or design pattern, for APIs. REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.

2. What does Stateless mean?

Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API. It doesnâ€™t remember if the user of the API already sent a GET request for the same resource in the past, it doesnâ€™t remember which resources the user of the API requested before, and so on.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

Under REST principles, a URL identifies a resource. The following URL design patterns are considered REST best practices: URLs should include nouns, not verbs. Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
