## Questions

>1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

That way you have a direction of how you want things to look instead of going in completely blind.

>2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Google is going to be your best friend. You will also get better at googling things as you get further in the course becasue then you know how to ask the more specific questions.

>3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

The biggest takeaways I got from that article was to plan before coding but not to plan too much before coding anything. Its best because planning before you start coding gives you a good idea of what youre working towards and if you plan too much, you start to overthink it and sometimes its just not possible to make it exactly how you planned and it can be discouraging.
